# Tune Tracker

This web application aims to fix a problem that the author faces,
they are unable to collect and remeber all the tunes they have
learned over the last decade of playing music.

Due to the personal nature of the web application it is currently
built around the needs of the creator. Therefore it uses terminology
from Irish Traditional Music and is limited when it comes to sheet
music and focues on audio and links to audio (due to the author's
lack of ability to read sheet music)!

If you wish for any features to be added please add it to the GitHub,
however chances are that the author will take some time to add them
as at the end of the day this is still a personal project.

the hard work of confirming users. This website specifically uses
